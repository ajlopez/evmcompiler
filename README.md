# EVM Compiler

Compiles an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) to Ethereum Virtual Machine bytecodes, WIP.

## Design

TBD

## Versions

- 0.0.1 First published version
- 0.0.2 Fix check datasize; fix  binary order evaluation; using geast@0.0.7
- 0.0.3 Process local variables, loop and conditional commands
- 0.0.4 Process break and continue commands
- 0.0.5 For command, fnhash in API, stop in void method, local variables management first implementation
- 0.0.6 Array variable declaration and access, signed mod and div, process call, context redesign, logical operations, addmod mulmod operations

## To Do

- Management of local variables (partial)
- Call private, internal, external methods
- Pass arguments in stack when needed
- Returns result in stack when needed
- Contract inheritance
- String support
- Mapping support
- Dynamic arrays support
- Static array support
- Call another contract
- Transfer value to another address
- Pure, view methods
- Generate ABI
